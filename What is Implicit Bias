<h1>What is implicit bias and why is it important?</h1>
<p>Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, and associations that influence our perceptions, actions, and decisions, often without our awareness. These biases contribute to societal inequities as they can lead to disparate treatment of people based on their race, gender, age, or other characteristics.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://diversity.ncsu.edu/news/2019/09/13/why-we-must-understand-and-address-implicit-bias-2/">
  Implicit biases simultaneously advantage certain groups while disadvantaging others. These biases can be seen in university admissions, job recruiting and selection, and even in the classroom. These biases greatly affect diversity in a number of ways.
